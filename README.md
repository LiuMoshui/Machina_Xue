# Machina_Xue
This repository contains Machine Learning (ML) projects of various types. Particularly in the often overlapping subfields of Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing (NLP), traditional Machine Learning, and Deep Learning (DL). My goal is to gradually add more complicated, niche projects over time. 

I gave this repository the name of Machina_Xue (Machina is latin for machine and Xue is mandarin for learning) as a shoutout to my philosophy that embracing unfamiliarity breeds creativity and that the key to future developement is a dignified involvement of the whole world.
